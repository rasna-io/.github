# Rasna

**Open-source building blocks for modern UI systems and developer tooling**

Rasna designs **reusable, production-grade libraries and tools** for UI-heavy software across **desktop, web, and cross-platform ecosystems**.

We focus on **infrastructure and primitives** behind great applications — not end-user apps.
